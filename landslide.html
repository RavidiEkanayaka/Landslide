    <section class="landslide">
        <h5>What is Landslid</h5>
        <p>Landslides are geological phenomena that occur when masses of rock, earth, or debris move down a slope under the force of gravity. They can happen in any part of the world, and are often triggered by natural events such as heavy rain, earthquakes, volcanic activity, and changes in the water level of rivers or oceans. Landslides can also be caused by human activities, such as deforestation, mining, and construction.
            The movement of a landslide can be very slow, or it can occur rapidly, with debris and rocks tumbling down the slope at high speed. The speed of a landslide is dependent on the type of material involved, the angle of the slope, and the amount of water present. Some landslides can travel for long distances, and can be very destructive, causing damage to property and infrastructure, and even loss of life.

        <h1>Reasons for Landslide</h1>
        <p><span style="color: #964B00; font-size: 20px;">Landslides can occur due to a variety of natural and human-made factors including :</span><br><br>
            1. <span style="color: #964B00;"> Geological factors</span>:<br> Geological factors such as the slope angle, soil type, rock type, and geological structure of an area can contribute to landslides. For example, steep slopes are more prone to landslides than gentler slopes. <br><br>
            2. <span style="color: #964B00;">Heavy rainfall</span>:<br> Heavy rainfall can saturate the soil and increase the weight of the soil mass, which can cause landslides. <br><br>
            3. <span style="color: #964B00;">Earthquakes</span>:<br> Earthquakes can destabilize slopes and cause landslides. <br><br>
            4. <span style="color: #964B00;">Vegetation removal</span>:<br> Deforestation, clear-cutting, and other forms of vegetation removal can destabilize slopes and increase the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            5. <span style="color: #964B00;">Human activity</span>:<br> Human activities such as construction, excavation, and mining can alter the landscape and increase the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            6. <span style="color: #964B00;">Climate change</span>:<br> Climate change can increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, which can increase the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            7. <span style="color: #964B00;">Natural erosion</span>:<br> Natural erosion can also contribute to landslides, as it can weaken the stability of slopes over time. <br><br>
            8. It is important to note that landslides often occur due to a combination of factors rather than a single cause. Understanding the causes of landslides can help in identifying areas at risk and taking necessary measures to prevent or mitigate their impact. <br><br>

        <!--Landslide in Sri Lanka-->
        <h5>Landslide in Sri Lanka</h5>
        <p><b>In Sri Lanka landslides are mostly triggered due to heavy and
            prolonged Rainfall.</b> During last few decades, landslides have occurred with increasing
            frequency and intensity, causing extensive damage to lives and properties. Therefore, it
            becomes a necessity to predict and warn landslide hazards before it actually takes place
            which is still a mammoth task to achieve. Although several researches were done based on
            daily rainfall data in Sri Lanka, <b>it has been identified that the extreme rainfalls with shorter
            durations could trigger more disastrous landslides.</b><br> Hence, recommending hourly rainfall
            thresholds for landslides is much important in terms of hazard warning and preparedness. In
            this research an hourly rainfall trend was proposed in order to predict occurrences of
            landslides in Sri Lanka considering hourly rainfall data from twelve hours before to any
            disastrous event. Special attention was paid to data from Badulla District where more than
            200 people were believed to be dead due to one major landslide in November 2014.Obtaining hourly rainfall data at exact location was almost
            impossible with the available rainfall measurement procedure in Sri Lanka. Much finer
            conclusions could have been made with more accurate data.

        <!--Rain types -->
        <h1> <span style="color: #964B00;">Rain Types</span> in Sri Lanka</h1>
        <p><span style="color: #964B00; font-size: 20px;">Sri Lanka experiences several types of rain throughout the year, depending on the location and the prevailing weather patterns. Some of the common types of rain in Sri Lanka include:</span> <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Southwest Monsoon</span>: <br> This is the primary rainy season in Sri Lanka, which occurs from May to September, and is caused by the southwest monsoon winds. During this time, the southwestern part of the country, including Colombo, receives the highest amount of rainfall. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Northeast Monsoon</span>: <br> The northeast monsoon occurs from December to February and affects the eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka. The rainfall during this time is less compared to the southwest monsoon, but it is still a significant contributor to the overall annual rainfall. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Convectional Rainfall</span>: <br> Convectional rainfall is caused by the heating of the land, which leads to the formation of cumulus clouds and thunderstorms. This type of rainfall is common in Sri Lanka during the inter-monsoon periods (October-November and March-April), particularly in the central and eastern regions of the country. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Orographic Rainfall</span>: <br> Orographic rainfall occurs when moist air is forced to rise over mountains, leading to the formation of clouds and rainfall. Sri Lanka's hilly terrain, particularly in the central highlands, makes it susceptible to orographic rainfall. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Cyclonic Rainfall</span>: <br> Cyclonic rainfall occurs when a tropical cyclone or a low-pressure system brings heavy rain and strong winds to the country. This type of rainfall is rare in Sri Lanka but can cause significant damage when it does occur. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> <span style="font-size: 20px;"> The following are some general guidelines for the amount of rainfall in millimeters that can be used to classify rainfall intensity:</span></b><br><br>

        <h1>Soil Types in Landslide Areas</h1>
        <p><span style="color: #964B00; font-size: 20px;">Sri Lanka has a diverse range of soil types that can be found in landslide-prone areas. Some of the common soil types found in these areas include:</span> <br><br>

            <span style="color: #964B00;"> Colluvium</span>:<br> Colluvium is a type of soil that is made up of unconsolidated rock fragments and soil that has accumulated <br>at the base of a slope due to gravity. It is common in areas with steep slopes and can be highly susceptible to landslides. <br><br>
            <img src="../static/images/colluvial.jpg" alt="waste" width="500px"><br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;"> Residual Soil</span>:<br> Residual soil is a type of soil that forms from the weathering of underlying bedrock. It is common in areas with hard rock<br> formations and can be highly variable in terms of its physical properties, making it difficult to predict landslide potential. <br><br>
            <img src="../static/images/Residualsoil.jpg" alt="waste" width="500px"><br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;"> Alluvial Soil</span>:<br> Alluvial soil is a type of soil that is deposited by rivers and streams. It is common in <br>low-lying areas and can be highly susceptible to landslides due to its loose and poorly compacted nature. <br><br>
            <img src="../static/images/AlluvialSoil.jpg" alt="waste" width="500px"><br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;"> Laterite Soil</span>:<br> Laterite soil is a type of soil that is formed from the weathering of basaltic rock. It is common <br>in hilly and mountainous areas and can be highly susceptible to landslides due to its high clay content and poor drainage. <br><br>
            <img src="../static/images/Laterite Soil.jpg" alt="waste" width="500px"><br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;"> Red Yellow Podzolic Soil</span>:<br> Red Yellow Podzolic soil is a type of soil that is formed from the weathering of granite and <br>gneiss rock. It is common in high altitude areas and can be highly susceptible to landslides due to its shallow depth and poor stability. <br><br>
            <img src="../static/images/Red Yellow Podzolic Soil.jpeg" alt="waste" width="350px"><br><br>
        </p><br>

        <!--Human Activity-->
        <h1>How Human activity causes landslides</h1>
        <p> <span style="color: #964B00; font-size: 20px;">Human activities can significantly contribute to the occurrence and severity of landslides in various ways:</span> <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Deforestation</span>: <br> Cutting down trees for timber, fuel, or to make room for agriculture or urbanization reduces the stability of slopes by increasing soil erosion and decreasing root reinforcement. This can lead to the failure of slopes and trigger landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Construction and excavation</span>:<br> Avoiding development in areas that are prone to landslides can be an effective way to reduce risk.<br> Land-use planning can help to ensure that development is appropriately sited and designed to minimize the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Poor land-use planning</span>:<br> Inadequate land-use planning can lead to construction in areas prone to landslides, such as steep slopes, areas with loose soil or rocks, or areas with high rainfall. This can increase the vulnerability of communities to landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Irrigation and drainage systems</span>:<br> Poorly designed or poorly maintained irrigation and drainage systems can cause landslides by altering the water balance on slopes, leading to soil saturation and instability. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Overgrazing</span>:<br> Overgrazing by livestock can lead to the removal of vegetation cover, reducing slope stability and increasing soil erosion. <br><br>
        </p>


        <!--Reduce Landslide-->
        <h1>How to Reduce Landslide</h1>
        <p> <span style="color: #964B00; font-size: 20px;">landslides cannot be completely prevented, there are measures that can be taken to reduce their frequency and impact. Here are some ways to reduce the risk of landslides:</span> <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Identify and Map Landslide-Prone Areas</span>: <br> Understanding the geography and geology of an area is critical to assessing the risk of landslides.<br> Mapping areas prone to landslides and identifying potential triggers (such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, or changes in land use)<br> can help identify areas where mitigation measures are most needed. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Implement Land-Use Planning</span>:<br> Avoiding development in areas that are prone to landslides can be an effective way to reduce risk.<br> Land-use planning can help to ensure that development is appropriately sited and designed to minimize the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Implement Slope Stabilization Measures</span>:<br> There are various measures that can be implemented to stabilize slopes and prevent landslides, including retaining walls, soil nails, rock bolts, and shotcrete.<br> These measures can help to prevent slope failure and reduce the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Install Drainage Systems</span>:<br> Proper drainage can help to prevent landslides by reducing the amount of water that infiltrates the soil and by stabilizing slopes.<br> Installing drainage systems such as French drains or culverts can help to manage water runoff and reduce the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Conduct Regular Inspections</span>:<br> Regular inspections of slopes and other potentially unstable areas can help to identify signs of instability and potential landslide triggers.<br> Early identification and mitigation of potential landslide hazards can help to reduce the risk of landslides. <br><br>
            <span style="color: #964B00;">Educate the Public</span>:<br> Raising awareness of landslide risks and providing information on how to prepare <br>for and respond to landslides can help to reduce the impact of these natural disasters. <br><br>
