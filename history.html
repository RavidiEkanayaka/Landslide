         <h6>KOSLANDA LANDSLIDE: October 2014</h6>
         <p>Monsoon rains in Sri Lanka caused a landslide on 29 October 2014, which is believed to have killed over a hundred people. 
             The landslide occurred near the town of Haldummulla and mud and debris buried approximately 150 houses, and potentially more 
             than a hundred residents. Hundreds of rescue personnel and the military have been searching for survivors, but as of 30 October 
             they think it unlikely that anyone still buried has survived. Some houses in the town have been buried in mud as deep as 9 
             etres (30 feet). Ten bodies have been recovered so far. Haldummulla is located in the Badulla district of Sri Lanka, an 
             agricultural region of the country. Sri Lanka has experienced other landslides in the past few months, due to further bouts of
             monsoon rain, but this latest incident has taken the highest toll in lives of the year.</p>

             settlement in the 1960s. Despite this change, the new settlers continued to grow tea and minor export crops as a livelihood. 
             The landslide also affected up to 350,000 people and left many displaced.This completely buried parts of several villages and 
             killed over 150 people and destroyed a large number of houses.  The land area affected by the landslide is more than 600 Hectares.
